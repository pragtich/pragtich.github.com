<p>Aquamacs is a great text editor for OS X. It does, however, have its
idiosyncrises. So, here I am keeping notes on what worked for me.</p>

<h1 id="documentation">Documentation</h1>

<p>First of all, Google is your friend. But there is also some
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AquamacsFAQ">good documentation on the EmacsWiki site</a>.</p>

<h1 id="configuration-file">Configuration file</h1>

<p>The Aquamacs does not use the standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.emacs</code> locations. Instead,
the stuff is hidden in the library. For details, check
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AquamacsFAQ">the Aquamacs FAQ</a>. I tend to edit the files in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/</code> by hand, especially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">customizations.el</code>.</p>

<p>To be honest, this exasperates me so much, that I have learned to use
the â€˜customizationâ€™ tool.</p>

<h1 id="emacsclient">Emacsclient</h1>

<p>In using Aquamacs, I wanted to start using it as the default
editor. Some research was needed.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>I edited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bash_profile</code> and added the following`;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!bash
# editor setup
export EDITOR='/Applications/Aquamacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient'
export ALTERNATE_EDITOR=vi
alias e=$EDITOR
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Probably I should research how to use ALTERNATE_EDITOR to startup
Aquamacs, but I want to be sure that I am actually on a windowing
station to do that â€“ too lazy at the moment. Maybe later. As it is
now, Aquamacs will be used when itâ€™s running (like when Iâ€™m working on
this website), and vi will be used otherwise.</p>

<p>It also sets up a shorthand editing alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code> for my convenience.</p>

<p>To get the server to automatically load, I used the customization
interface (Aquamacs -&gt; Preferences, Interfacing to external
utilities, Server) to enable â€˜Server Modeâ€™. That way, any time
Aquamacs starts up, it will be listening.</p>

<h2 id="using">Using</h2>

<p>Ending an editing session that was started this way, goes as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C-x #
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many people rebind this key to something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C-c c</code> to better match
other applications like GNUS or VCS. Maybe I will too, some day.</p>
