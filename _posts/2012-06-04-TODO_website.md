# Some things that I still intend to do with this site #

* ADD A picture of my configuration screens in `luci` to the layout
  page.
* Add photo of line of sight to network-layout
* Add "title" stuff so that a Markdown image gets a caption (javascript?)
* Devise a more structured way of working with images, flowing them in the text etc.
* Make sure that titles in the title list also get passed through rubypants
* Research

* Make images work with a full size image clickable through the thumbnail
* Add an 'all categories' button in the nav pane
* make the 'about' page
* Switch from categories to tags?
* Add code coloration
* Complete redesign of blog pages 

# DONE

* Make a design that actually numbers <ol> and not <ul>
